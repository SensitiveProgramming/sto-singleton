# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```

Try running some of the following tasks (shorthand version):

```shell
npx hh help
npx hh compile
npx hh test
npx hh node
```
